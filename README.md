[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bioengineering-toolbox/badge/?version=latest)](http://bioengineering-toolbox.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

## Synopsis

This project is aimed at collecting tips and tricks for bioengineering researchers.

## Motivation

The repository was created to provide a first stop, toolbox that answers 'how-to' style questions that researchers find themselves asking while working on bioengineering projects. The aim is for researchers to contribute to this toolbox to create a rich database that everyone would benefit from.
